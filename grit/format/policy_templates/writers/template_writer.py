class TemplateWriter(object):
  '''Abstract base class for writing policy templates in various formats.
  The methods of this class will be called by PolicyTemplateGenerator.
  '''

  def __init__(self, config, messages):
    '''Initializes a TemplateWriter object.

    Args:
      config: A dictionary of information required to generate the template.
        It contains some key-value pairs, including the following examples:
          'build': 'chrome' or 'chromium'
          'branding': 'Google Chrome' or 'Chromium'
          'mac_bundle_id': The Mac bundle id of Chrome. (Only set when building
            for Mac.)
      messages: List of all the message strings from the grd file. Most of them
        are also present in the policy data structures that are passed to
        methods. That is the preferred way of accessing them, this should only
        be used in exceptional cases. An example for its use is the
        IDS_POLICY_WIN_SUPPORTED_WINXPSP2 message in ADM files, because that
        cannot be associated with any policy or group.
